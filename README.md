# 🧠 TumorApp UI  

This repository contains the **main user interface** for the Tumor Detection Application.  
It acts as the bridge between:  
- **Supabase** → for authentication and secure storage  
- **Hugging Face** → where the tumor detection ML model is deployed  

The UI enables users to interact with the system seamlessly and view final predictions in a user-friendly environment.
